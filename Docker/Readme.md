# Docker   
Docker is a very popular and powerful open source containerization platform that is used for billing, deploying and running apps.   
It's main purpose is to decouple apps/software from the underlying infrastructure.   

#### What is Container?   
A unit of software bundled with dependencies which helps apps to be deployed fast and reliably between different computing platforms.   
   
In simpler terms it can be assumed docker as a big ship carrying huge boxes of products(containers) just to deploy to production with minimal config changes.   
   
Docker container doesn't require the installation of OS. It just relies on the usage of Kernel's resources and its functionality to allocate them for the CPU and memory.   
   
Containers can be deployed on multiple platforms like bare instances, virtual machines, Kubernetes platform etc as per requirements basis of scale or desired platform.   
   
The main aim of docker containers is to get rid of the infrastructure dependency while deploying and running apps, which means any containerized app can run on any platform irrespective of the infra being used behind the scenes.   
   
In technical terms, they are just run time instances of **DOCKER IMAGES**.   
   
#### What are Docker Images?   
Docker images are executable packages bundled with application code & dependencies, software packages etc for the purpose of creating containers. These images can be deployed to any docker environment and the containers can be spun up there to run the application.   
   
In order to create a docker images a list of commands has to be executed which are present in a **DOCKER FILE**.
